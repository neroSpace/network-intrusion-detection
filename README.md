# network-intrusion-detection
ðŸ“Œ Description:

Welcome to my repository showcasing an innovative approach to Network Intrusion Detection using Graph Anomaly detection techniques. In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, safeguarding network infrastructures from malicious activities is of paramount importance. This project presents a cutting-edge solution harnessing the power of machine learning and graph analysis to identify anomalous behaviors within network traffic.

ðŸš€ Key Features:

Graph-Based Representation: Our approach leverages graph theory to model network interactions, transforming the intricate web of connections into a structured graph representation.

Anomaly Detection: By training advanced machine learning models on this graph data, we empower the system to discern between normal and abnormal network behaviors.

Scalability: The solution is built with scalability in mind, making it adaptable to networks of varying sizes without compromising on performance.

ðŸŒŸ Why This Matters:

Traditional intrusion detection systems often struggle to keep up with evolving attack strategies. By adopting a graph-based approach, we enable the system to capture complex patterns and relationships that might go unnoticed by conventional methods. This repository exemplifies my commitment to pushing the boundaries of security solutions through innovative technologies.

ðŸ“Š Tech Stack:

Python for data preprocessing and model development

NetworkX for graph modeling

PyGOD for anomaly detection

ðŸ‘¥ Collaboration:

I welcome collaboration and feedback from fellow developers, security enthusiasts, and anyone interested in enhancing network security. Together, we can fortify our digital landscapes against emerging threats.
